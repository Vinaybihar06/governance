# Template Description

## Title: Medical Equipments for Community Health Centre
Main Objectives :
To facilitate in prevention, mitigation, and containment of public health emergencies.

## Background: 
Poor people in urban and rural areas face a huge burden of ill health: almost 10% of them have had at- least one illness in the past two weeks. Despite high burden of illness, many—as many as one in five—do not seek any healthcare. When they seek care, they often do so from informal private providers, because of ease of reaching them, flexible payment options, and extended hours of service. Families also end up spending significant money (almost ₹ 300 for an out-patient consultation, and almost ₹ 2000 for in-patient) despite receiving poor quality of care. It is not surprising, then, that expenditure on healthcare is one of the major reasons for families slipping into indebtedness in rural Bihar.On account of absence of the adult male from the household and erratic availability of liquid cash, families of migrants are even more likely to defer treatment when ill, and more likely to fall into indebtedness due to expenditure on healthcare. Migrants themselves have higher vulnerability to illness due to the unhealthy and unhygienic environment in which they work and live. Being less familiar with the city and its healthcare systems, and having limited liquid cash, they defer seeking care when ill, or go back to the “pastures” they know better: their own village, prematurely breaking the migration tenure and further reducing their income.

## Motivation: 

we seen that more than hundres of families lost their members due to covid lack of health care bad system in bihar,india.

## For/Against:

More than 5000 families directly or indirectly get benifited from the medical equipments we are nonprofitable organizatiion under which last wave of pandemics provide free of cost services to covid patients.
