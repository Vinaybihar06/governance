# Governance Process 

## 1. Governance Forum - gov.epns.io

This is a Discourse-hosted forum for governance-related discussion. Community members must register for an account before participating. Proposals on the forum must be submitted following a template.
On the forum, a proposal must follow 2 steps, first the Governance Proposals and then the Governance Discussion.
1.a. Governance Proposals
This is the first step for every proposal. Proposals, following the template, can be posted under Governance Proposals before being promoted to the Governance Discussions category. Once consensus is achieved, proposals may be prepared and pushed through the formal process entailing:
Formal proposal to be posted in the Governance Discussion. Champions approval is needed before being accepted to act as a filter.
PUSH Delegatees, if they support the proposal, can then make it available on EPNS Snapshot for voting.

Champions will move the proposal from the Governance Proposals to the Governance Discussion if they meet the following criteria:
Must follow the Draft Proposal Template 
Must be submitted Governance Proposal section
Must be live for 5+ days
Must have 5 Likes (minimum)
Formulate clear for and against positions

In this category, proposals are discussed before they go up for voting.
This channel is intended to serve as the last step before submitting a proposal to Snapshot.
Proposals can be pushed through to this category once enough traction has been gained in the Governance Proposals.
Only Champions can push through Governance Discussion from the Governance Proposals.
From here, proposals will be pushed to Snapshot for voting to commence. Only PUSH Delegatees will be able to submit a proposal in Snapshot.

PUSH Delegatees can move proposals from the Governance Discussion to Snapshot if the proposal meets the following criteria:
The proposal must follow the pre-defined proposal template
The proposal MUST have a proper title to reveal the core idea
The proposal MUST begin with Summary section (in short, please)
The proposal can have Background, Motivation, Specification, or any other aspect to support the idea or use the EIP template
Must be live for 5+ days in the Governance Discussion category
Proposal on Forum must receive at least 10 likes
Proposal on Forum must have a minimum of 3 replies

2. Snapshot 
Once the proposal on the Governance Discussion category meets the necessary criteria, formal voting can take place on Snapshot. Votes on Snapshot are weighted by the number of $PUSH delegated to the address used to vote. A minimum of 75,000 $PUSH tokens are required to create a proposal.
